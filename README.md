# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML
Nowadays,Diabetes has become a common disease to the mankind from young to the old Persons. There are various reasons due to which the population of diabetic patients is increasing day by day. Hence, early prediction of diabetes is very essential to save the human life from diabetes. In order to do this we develop a system using machine learning algorithms and find out the initial symptoms of diabetes.The result of our method shows better performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy. We have applied many ML algorithms on Diabetes dataset and the performance of those algorithms have been analysed.
